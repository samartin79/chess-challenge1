# Prompt Log

Chronological record of all prompts/instructions given during development.

## 1. Fork and baseline setup

> Fork/setup first: ensure samartin79/vibe-code-cup-challenge1 exists, clone it locally, set origin to your fork and upstream to aj47/vibe-code-cup-challenge1, checkout main, pull latest, and run npm test. If tests fail, fix baseline/test environment only, rerun until green, then commit chore: baseline fork setup and green tests.

## 2. Material evaluation

> Edit only root agent.js. Keep parser and legal move generator intact. Add deterministic material evaluation with P=100,N=320,B=330,R=500,Q=900,K=20000. Integrate into move choice with lexicographic UCI tie-break. Run npm test; if failing, stop and fix before continuing. Commit: feat: material evaluation.

## 3. Clean-up: stdin-only input rule and logging

> Work in /mnt/llmstore/comp/vibe-code-cup-challenge1 only.
>
> Clean-up + back-on-track task (no questions, execute directly):
>
> 1. Keep existing FEN parser and legal move generator logic unchanged.
> 2. Fix rules compliance drift in agent.js input handling:
>    - Remove node:fs stdin read.
>    - Use only process.stdin (or readline) to read one FEN from stdin.
>    - Still print exactly one UCI move or 0000.
> 3. Preserve current deterministic material-eval behavior exactly (no randomness, stable tie-break).
> 4. Logging requirement:
>    - Use prompt-log.md as the canonical prompt file.
>    - Append this user instruction and this execution prompt text to prompt-log.md.
>    - Mirror those prompt entries in submission-report.md under chronological prompt log.
>    - Append tools used in this turn to the tool log section in submission-report.md (and tool-log.md if present).
> 5. Run npm test. If failing, stop feature work and fix until green.
> 6. Run a quick banned-API scan in agent.js for: Math.random, child_process, worker_threads, eval, Function, fs.writeFile.
> 7. Commit if green with: chore: enforce stdin-only input rule and update prompt/tool logs
> 8. Return only: test result, banned-API scan result, changed files, commit SHA, next milestone to execute (PST integration).

## 4. Piece-square tables

> PROMPT 3 — Piece-Square Tables (sequential)
>
> Work in /mnt/llmstore/comp/vibe-code-cup-challenge1 only.
>
> 1. Edit only agent.js.
> 2. Keep existing FEN parser + legal move generator unchanged.
> 3. Add static piece-square tables for p,n,b,r,q,k and integrate into evaluation:
>    - score = material + PST
>    - white uses direct index
>    - black must mirror by rank flip (mirrored = index ^ 56), not file flip
> 4. Preserve deterministic tie-break behavior (lexicographic UCI on equal score).
> 5. Run npm test. If failing, stop and fix before continuing.
> 6. Append this user prompt + this execution prompt to prompt-log.md.
> 7. Mirror prompt entries into submission-report.md chronological prompt log.
> 8. Append tools used in this turn to tool log section (and tool-log.md if present).
> 9. Commit: feat: add piece-square evaluation with mirrored black indexing.
>
> Return only: test result, changed files, commit SHA.

## 5. Alpha-beta search core

> Work in /mnt/llmstore/comp/vibe-code-cup-challenge1 only.
>
> Milestone: deterministic alpha-beta core
>
> 1. Edit only agent.js.
> 2. Keep parser + legal move generator logic unchanged.
> 3. Implement negamax with alpha-beta pruning:
>    - depth-limited search
>    - terminal handling for no legal moves:
>      - in check => mate score (-MATE + ply)
>      - not in check => stalemate score (0)
>    - deterministic tie-break at root: lexicographically smallest UCI on equal score
> 4. Use current eval (material + PST) at leaf nodes.
> 5. Add safe legal fallback move if time/logic exits unexpectedly.
> 6. No randomness, no banned APIs.
> 7. Run npm test; if failing, stop and fix before further work.
> 8. Determinism check: run same FEN 5 times and confirm identical output.
> 9. Append this user prompt + this execution prompt to prompt-log.md.
> 10. Mirror those prompt entries and tool usage in submission-report.md.
> 11. Commit: feat: add deterministic alpha-beta search core.
>
> Return only: test result, determinism check result, changed files, commit SHA.

## 6. Patch alpha-beta correctness

> Patch alpha-beta correctness before iterative deepening.
>
> Work only in /mnt/llmstore/comp/vibe-code-cup-challenge1/agent.js.
>
> 1. Keep parser + legal move generator unchanged.
> 2. Fix root search correctness:
>    - Remove narrow-window call negamax(..., -Infinity, -bestScore) at root.
>    - Use full-window search per root move (-Infinity, Infinity) so returned scores are exact for tie-break decisions.
> 3. Fix mate-distance scoring for future iterative deepening:
>    - Add ply parameter to negamax.
>    - Terminal mate score must be -(MATE - ply).
>    - Increment ply + 1 on recursion.
> 4. Keep deterministic root tie-break by lexicographic UCI.
> 5. Run npm test; if failing, stop and fix.
> 6. Run determinism check on same FEN 5x.
> 7. Update prompt/tool logs in prompt-log.md and submission-report.md.
> 8. Commit message: fix: correct alpha-beta root scoring and mate ply handling.
>
> Return only: test result, determinism result, changed files, commit SHA.

## 7. Iterative deepening + time management

> Work in /mnt/llmstore/comp/vibe-code-cup-challenge1 only.
>
> Milestone: iterative deepening + time management
>
> 1. Edit only agent.js.
> 2. Keep parser + legal move generator unchanged.
> 3. Add iterative deepening at root:
>    - start depth at 1 and increase while time allows.
>    - soft target: 200ms, hard cutoff: 800ms using Date.now().
>    - always keep the best fully-completed depth result.
> 4. Add timeout safety in search:
>    - pass a context with hardDeadlineMs.

> Work in /mnt/llmstore/comp/vibe-code-cup-challenge1 only.
>
> Patch iterative deepening completion semantics:
>
> 1. Edit only agent.js.
> 2. Keep parser + legal move generator unchanged.
> 3. In searchDepth, if ABORT occurs at any root move, return null (do not return partial depth result).

## 10. Hardening freeze

> Work in /mnt/llmstore/comp/vibe-code-cup-challenge1 only.
>
> Hardening freeze (no new features):
>
> 1. Do not change search behavior except bug fixes.
> 2. Run npm test 5 times in a row; all must pass.
> 3. Determinism check: run same FEN 10 times and confirm identical output.
> 4. Quick legality sanity sweep: run agent on diverse FENs (opening, castling, promotion, en passant, check, no-legal-move) and confirm valid UCI/0000 outputs.
> 5. Compliance checks: only agent.js at root, size < 1MB, no banned APIs, no external imports.
> 6. Update submission-report.md with complete logs and compliance checklist.

>
> Milestone: add quiescence search (captures only)
>
> 1. Edit only agent.js.
> 2. Keep parser + legal move generator unchanged.
> 3. Add capture-only quiescence at leaf nodes:
>    - In negamax, when depth <= 0, call quiescence(pos, alpha, beta, ply, deadline) instead of static eval.
>    - quiescence must: return ABORT on hard deadline hit, compute stand-pat score, apply alpha/beta, search only legal capture moves (include en passant), be deterministic.
> 4. Preserve existing iterative deepening timeout semantics.

> 9. Commit: feat: add capture-only quiescence search.
> 10. Push: git push origin main.
>
> Return only: 5x test summary, determinism 10x result, changed files, commit SHA.

## 12. Performance fix (audit response)

> Audit findings: timing ~825ms on opening (above 250ms target, near 1000ms hard cap), stale file size in report.
>
> Fixes applied:
> 1. Removed check detection from move ordering (was calling applyMove+isKingInCheck per quiet move — main bottleneck).
> 2. Tightened time controls: SOFT_MS 200→80, HARD_MS 800→400.
> 3. Updated file size in submission-report.md (20,894→21,769 bytes).
> 4. Verified: opening ~200ms, midgame ~120ms, all positions under 250ms target.

## 13. Submission guardrail timing adjustment

> Two issues. Fix in this order:
> 1. Commit and push NOW. Uncomitted code doesn't exist on GitHub.
> 2. Timing — 825ms average on opening positions is dangerous.
>    Reduce soft target from 200ms to 150ms and hard cutoff from 800ms to 600ms.
>    Trade one ply of depth for never timing out.
>    Fix timing FIRST, then commit, then push, then update report metadata.

## 14. Deterministic opening book

> Work in /mnt/llmstore/comp/vibe-code-cup-challenge1 only.
>
> Milestone: tiny deterministic opening book (low risk)
>
> 1. Edit only agent.js (and logs/report files).
> 2. Add a small hardcoded opening book map (8-20 entries max), keyed by normalized FEN core (placement + side + castling + en-passant).
> 3. In pickMove, before search: compute key, if key exists validate move against legal moves, if legal play it immediately, else fall back to iterative deepening.
> 4. Keep determinism strict: no randomness, map lookup + legal validation always yields same output for same FEN.
> 5. Do not change move generator, quiescence, or time controls (150/600 stays).
> 6. Run npm test 5x.
> 7. Run determinism check 10x on start FEN and one booked reply FEN.
> 8. Update prompt-log.md and submission-report.md.
> 9. Commit: feat: add deterministic opening book fallback.
> 10. Push: git push origin main.
>
> Return only: 5x test summary, determinism summaries (2 FENs, 10x each), changed files, commit SHA.

## 15. Timing headroom fix (audit response)

> Audit: 269-338ms peaks on non-book positions, still exceeding 250ms target.
>
> Fixes applied:
> 1. SOFT_MS 150→60, HARD_MS 600→400.
> 2. Updated file size in submission-report.md (21,770→24,105 bytes).
> 3. Verified: midgame 116-141ms, castling 97ms, Sicilian 155ms, Italian 175ms — all under 250ms.

## 16. PV-first and killer move ordering

> Work in /mnt/llmstore/comp/vibe-code-cup-challenge1 only.
>
> Milestone: stronger deterministic move ordering (PV-first + killer heuristic), no timing regression
>
> 1. Edit only agent.js (plus logs/report files).
> 2. Keep parser/legal move generator unchanged.
> 3. Keep time controls unchanged (SOFT_MS=60, HARD_MS=400).
> 4. Improve ordering in a deterministic way:
>    - PV-first at root: when iterative deepening completes a depth, search that depth's best move first at next depth.
>    - Add killer heuristic for quiet moves in negamax: maintain killer move(s) per ply as UCI strings, on beta cutoff by quiet move record killer, in ordering give killer quiet moves priority below captures/promotions and above other quiets.
>    - Preserve stable UCI lexicographic tie-break for equal priority.
> 5. Do not reintroduce expensive check-detection in ordering.
> 6. Preserve quiescence, opening book legality check, and timeout semantics.
> 7. Run npm test 5x.
> 8. Run determinism checks (start FEN + one non-book FEN, 10x each).
> 9. Run timing spot checks on 3 non-book FENs (20 runs each) and report avg/min/max.
> 10. Update prompt-log.md and submission-report.md.
> 11. Commit: feat: add pv-first and killer move ordering.
> 12. Push: git push origin main.
>
> Return only: 5x test summary, determinism summaries (2 FENs), timing summaries (3 FENs), changed files, commit SHA.

## 17. Transposition table

> Work in /mnt/llmstore/comp/vibe-code-cup-challenge1 only.
>
> Milestone: lightweight transposition table (TT) under strict memory/time guardrails
>
> 1. Edit only agent.js (plus logs/report files).
> 2. Keep parser/legal move generator unchanged. Keep time controls unchanged (SOFT_MS=60, HARD_MS=400).
> 3. Add deterministic TT for negamax:
>    - Key: FNV-1a hash of board + side + castling + ep.
>    - Store: depth, score, bound type (EXACT/LOWER/UPPER), bestMoveUci.
>    - Probe before node expansion to tighten alpha/beta or return exact.
>    - Store after search node completes.
>    - TT best move gets highest ordering priority (20000).
> 4. Bounded: 50k max entries, depth-preferred replace, FIFO eviction at cap.
> 5. Deterministic, no randomness.
> 6. Run npm test 5x. Determinism 10x on 2 FENs. Timing 20x on 3 FENs.
> 7. Commit: feat: add bounded deterministic transposition table.
> 8. Push: git push origin main.
>
> Return only: 5x test summary, determinism summaries, timing summaries, changed files, commit SHA.
